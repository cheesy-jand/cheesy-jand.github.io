- **Julie's comments**: Does not taste just like parmesan, unfortunately. Hard, a bit grainy, starchy. Similar flavor to nutritional yeast - umami, salty. Performed okay blended into pesto. By itself, icky - mixed in with stuff, ok.  **0.8/5**
- **Andrew's comments**: Yeah definitely not parmesanâ€¦ tastes a little more similar when dusted, but eating a chunk is unpleasant texture & salty taste that isn't super cheesy.  **0.6/5**
