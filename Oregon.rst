- **Style**: Flavored
- **Milk**: Cow
- **Purchase location**: Carlinos
- **Purchase date**: 09/17/22
- **Julie's comments**: Ivory color with orange irregular bits and tiny cracks throughout. Crumbly aged cheddar texture, but creamier. Buttery, paprika-y/cumin/garlic/salty & nutty - supposed to have a bit of ginger & maybe subtle cayenne (but I taste no ginger. Good interesting flavor but quite rich - tastes like salami!  **2.83/5**
- **Andrew's comments**: Garlicky, oniony, spiced flavors mixed into semi sharp white cheddar-like cheese. Crumbly & a bit mealy texture, not my favorite. Would be goo on top of a pasta or bread, but nothing special alone.  **1.8/5**
- **Thanks to Barb & Rob Necarsulmer for this cheese!**
