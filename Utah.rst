- **Style**: Cheddar
- **Milk**: Cow
- **Purchase location**: Harris Teater
- **Purchase date**: 02/23/22
- **Julie's comments**: Tan firm cheese, no rind. Caramel notes upfront, with a mild salty/acidic tang later, melts well. Tastes like a mild cheddar with a hint of booze. Best with bourbon, meh alone.  **1.98/5**
- **Andrew's comments**: Fairly mild, a bit sharp like white cheddar. I don't really taste the bourbon, except maybe slightly at rind. Very forgettable honestly.  **1.3/5**
