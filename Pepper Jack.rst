- **Julie's comments**: Decidedly not spicy! Except for like 3 random bites throughout the whole block. Those spicy bits were good, creamy jack. Disappointing, false advertising.  **0.5/5**
- **Andrew's comments**: Very disappointing, very unspicy, very little flavor. Made a decent quesodilla.  **0.5/5**
