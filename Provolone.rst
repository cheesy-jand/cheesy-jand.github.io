- **Origin**: Italy
- **Milk**: Cow
- **Purchase location**: Unknown
- **Purchase date**: 01/09/22
- **Julie's comments**: Sharp, salty, tangy, SHARP cheese, with nutty undertones. Great with a zesty pasta sauce and an Italian red wine. Firm, dense, and layered/stringy texture with flavor that lingers. Stands well alone.  **3.96/5**
- **Andrew's comments**: Sharp and salty, tastes a bit like the Pecorino Romano I think, but more subtle. Crumbly texture, slightly grainy. Pretty good, but not super memorable.  **2.6/5**
- **Thanks to Giulia Fragola for this cheese!**
