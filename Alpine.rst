- **Origin**: Vermont
- **Milk**: Cow
- **Purchase location**: Whole Foods
- **Purchase date**: 07/09/22
- **Julie's comments**: Yellowy tan firm cheese with a crusty rind. Chalky texture a bit, but still kinda smooth. Earthy, very woodsy flavor with a mild sharpness at end. Reminds me of comte.  **2.23/5**
- **Andrew's comments**: Flavor pretty mild, earthy, with some later funk that reminds me of fondue in a way. Chalky texture, not my favorite. Addendum: Not so mild actually, distinctly unlikeable taste (but not terrible).  **1.3/5**

Challerhocker (Wegmans)

- **Origin**: Switzerland
- **Milk**: Cow
- **Purchase location**: Wegmans
- **Purchase date**: 09/04/22
- **Julie's comments**: Tan/pale firm cheese with a waxy crumbly rind. Creamy & mildly grainy texture, dissolves quickly. Salty up front, then grassy and then funky (static up the back of nose at end, especially the rind). At first I really didn't like it, but better on day 2.  **1.53/5**
- **Andrew's comments**: This one's ok, a bit overly salty and rather funky in hay-like way. Some nice grains in texture. Does go up nose, less pleasant.  **0.8/5**

Fontina Fontal (FABES)

- **Origin**: Italy
- **Milk**: Cow
- **Purchase location**: Whole Foods
- **Purchase date**: 10/26/22
- **Julie's comments**: Pale ivory-ish cheese with a patterned orange waxy rind, firm. Creamy, mildly gummy texture that disintegrates in the mouth. Very mild cheese - a bit nutty & salty but overall neutral, yet not too boring. Would be great paired with any yummy jam.  **3.04/5**
- **Andrew's comments**: Mild, buttery, with a bit of sharp & tangy finish. Reminds me a bit of an artisinal fancier Muenster. Nice semi firm, semi chewy texture. Not the most exciting, has some "cheese cube" vibes, but super snackable & easy to put away a lot. Probably nice melted on sammie.  **3.5/5**

- **Origin**: Wisconsin
- **Milk**: Cow
- **Purchase location**: Whole Foods
- **Purchase date**: 08/15/22
- **Julie's comments**: Firm, pale tan cheese with a darker edge & a brownish gray rind. Gritty texture, salty, and pretty grassy/earthy flavor. Reminds me of a gruyere. Decent cheese, not the most versatile, but okay.  **2.28/5**
- **Andrew's comments**: Gummy & gritty texture, grassy/livestocky flavor, mild in center but funkier rind. Reminds me of a few others which generally aren't my favorite.  **1.7/5**

- **Origin**: Wisconsin
- **Milk**: Cow
- **Purchase location**: Whole Foods
- **Purchase date**: 04/06/22
- **Julie's comments**: Tan firm cheese that gets slightly darker towards the thin waxy rind. Subtle flavor - grassy and a bit tangy. Texture is a bit gritty/crumbly - not excellent. Pretty boring - needs a jam or something - or grilling!  **2.25/5**
- **Andrew's comments**: Flavor is unusual, if subtle and a bit boring. Can't figure out exactly what uniqueness is. Maybe cottage cheese? With a bit of sweetness. Semi-firm texture, bit of grit.  **2.0/5**
