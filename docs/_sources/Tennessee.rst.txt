- **Style**: Brie-like
- **Milk**: Cow
- **Purchase location**: Whole Foods
- **Purchase date**: 07/09/22
- **Julie's comments**: Yellowy firm cheese with a bleu-ish mottled line in the middle & a maxy tan rind. Tastes like fake butter, but too much, and fake onion slightly. Creamy, fatty taste, also a bit sweet. Tastes processed but doesn't feel processed? I think it's the over the top butter...  **2.15/5**
- **Andrew's comments**: Sue me, I like butter! Tasty, buttery, tangy, with a tiny bit of farmy aftertaste. Interesting texture, semi chewy inside, bit harder rind. Super snackable solo, would also be great grated over pasta.  **4.0/5**
