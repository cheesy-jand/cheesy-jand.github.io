- **Origin**: Vermont
- **Milk**: Cow
- **Purchase location**: Whole Foods
- **Purchase date**: 07/09/22
- **Julie's comments**: Yellowy tan firm cheese with a crusty rind. Chalky texture a bit, but still kinda smooth. Earthy, very woodsy flavor with a mild sharpness at end. Reminds me of comte.  **2.23/5**
- **Andrew's comments**: Flavor pretty mild, earthy, with some later funk that reminds me of fondue in a way. Chalky texture, not my favorite. Addendum: Not so mild actually, distinctly unlikeable taste (but not terrible).  **1.3/5**

- **Origin**: Wisconsin
- **Milk**: Cow
- **Purchase location**: Whole Foods
- **Purchase date**: 08/15/22
- **Julie's comments**: Firm, pale tan cheese with a darker edge & a brownish gray rind. Gritty texture, salty, and pretty grassy/earthy flavor. Reminds me of a gruyere. Decent cheese, not the most versatile, but okay.  **2.28/5**
- **Andrew's comments**: Gummy & gritty texture, grassy/livestocky flavor, mild in center but funkier rind. Reminds me of a few others which generally aren't my favorite.  **1.7/5**

- **Origin**: Wisconsin
- **Milk**: Cow
- **Purchase location**: Whole Foods
- **Purchase date**: 04/06/22
- **Julie's comments**: Tan firm cheese that gets slightly darker towards the thin waxy rind. Subtle flavor - grassy and a bit tangy. Texture is a bit gritty/crumbly - not excellent. Pretty boring - needs a jam or something - or grilling!  **2.25/5**
- **Andrew's comments**: Flavor is unusual, if subtle and a bit boring. Can't figure out exactly what uniqueness is. Maybe cottage cheese? With a bit of sweetness. Semi-firm texture, bit of grit.  **2.0/5**
