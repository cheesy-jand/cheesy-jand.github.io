- **Style**: Gruyere
- **Milk**: Cow
- **Purchase location**: Weaver Street
- **Purchase date**: 07/10/22
- **Julie's comments**: Tan cheese, firm, with a brown crusty, crumbly rind. Salty, tangy, grassy, a bit cattle-y? In a nice way. Like comte and also a little cheddar vibes, rind is funky. Creamy, gummy texture. Would be good with jam or pepper jelly.  **2.95/5**
- **Andrew's comments**: Barny, tangy flavor, reminds me of raclette (the cheese, not act), or even fondue flavor. Not my favorite. Texture is a bit gummy, flavor sticks in mouth a while.  **1.6/5**

- **Style**: Alpine
- **Milk**: Cow
- **Purchase location**: Wegmans
- **Purchase date**: 09/04/22
- **Julie's comments**: Tan/pale firm cheese with a waxy crumbly rind. Creamy & mildly grainy texture, dissolves quickly. Salty up front, then grassy and then funky (static up the back of nose at end, especially the rind). At first I really didn't like it, but better on day 2.  **1.53/5**
- **Andrew's comments**: This one's ok, a bit overly salty and rather funky in hay-like way. Some nice grains in texture. Does go up nose, less pleasant.  **0.8/5**

- **Style**: Other
- **Milk**: Cow
- **Purchase location**: Whole Foods
- **Purchase date**: 10/30/21
- **Julie's comments**: Creamy, nutty, smooth with subtle funkiness. Semi hard, off-white color. Stands alone but great with chips, definitely a fave.  **4.68/5**
- **Andrew's comments**: Very nice cheese to eat alone (like by itself, you can be with loved ones). Nutty, creamy, but subtle, very umami.  **4.3/5**

- **Style**: Other
- **Milk**: Cow
- **Purchase location**: Whole Foods
- **Purchase date**: 03/26/22
- **Julie's comments**: Firm off white/yellowish cheese with a thin speckled white rind. Mild, nutty, earthy slightly sharp flavor, a bit sweet. Gummy/sticky/thick texture. Needs melting/toasting or something. Would be good raclette. Underwhelming, but not bad.  **1.6/5**
- **Andrew's comments**: Mild, slightly sharp white cheese. Chewy/gooey, sort of unpleasant texture. Agreed, might be better melty, but pretty boring elsewise.  **1.4/5**
