- **Style**: Cheddar
- **Milk**: Cow
- **Purchase location**: Harris Teeter

- **Julie's comments**: Sharp, aged, creamy white cheddar, kinda tangy. Crumbly sort of, melts in chunks, good with spice, would be good with spreads or dried fruit maybe. Pretty average cheese.  **3.05/5**
- **Andrew's comments**: Solid white cheddar, sharp & nice crumbly texture. Above average but only just. Nice with salty chips.  **3.0/5**
