- **Style**: Brie-like
- **Milk**: Cow
- **Purchase location**: Weaver Street
- **Purchase date**: 01/31/22
- **Julie's comments**: Mild, soft but not oozy-soft Brie with classic appearance. Creamy but not overwhelmingly so. Rind a bit hard and bitter or dirty-tasting. Overall pretty meh but I don't hate it, which is an improvement for me and Brie I guess.  **2.02/5**
- **Andrew's comments**: Nice classic Brie, a bit creamy, a bit funky, but not too much. Pretty standard for  Brie, but I like Brie. Was better the first couple of days, feels like it lost a bit of flavor.  **3.1/5**
