- **Origin**: Wisconsin
- **Milk**: Goat
- **Purchase location**: Unknown
- **Purchase date**: 11/24/22
- **Julie's comments**: Blue! Stinky! Has a mottled grainy brown thin rind with an ivory & blue/green middle. Firm & crumbly, relatively smooth texture. Salty & funky in the way that goes to the back of the throat. It's not toooo moldy old blue cheese - salt helps balance.  **2.81/5**
- **Andrew's comments**: Salty, funky blue taste, rich but not overpowering. Really nice subtle flavor compared to more standard Blues. Bit of strange aftertaste though, slightly metallic. Great texture, firmer than other Blues, crumbly & chewy simultaneously. Afternote: their website describes texture as fudgy, which is perfect description.  **4.1/5**
- **Thanks to Manki Kim & Zoey Song for this cheese!**

- **Origin**: Wisconsin
- **Milk**: Cow
- **Purchase location**: Giant
- **Purchase date**: 05/28/22
- **Julie's comments**: Salty, stinky, funky, creamy crumbly white & blue-grey cheese with no rind. Usually not my thing, but this is pretty good with savory foods, less salty chips (cheese itself very salty)  **2.34/5**
- **Andrew's comments**: Salty, funky, creamier than most blue. Tasty in food (on buffalo chik patties, in stirfry), but ok solo or with chips too. Gets kind of old though, don't want too much of it.  **2.3/5**
- **Thanks to Barb & Rob Necarsulmer for this cheese!**

- **Origin**: England
- **Milk**: Cow
- **Purchase location**: Whole Foods
- **Purchase date**: 08/16/22
- **Julie's comments**: It's blue! Or rather tan & crumbly, streaked with grayish blue lines. Very salty, funky & staticky, especially in the very blue parts. Non-blue parts are salty, buttery, melt on your tongue. Not my fave, but not bad for blue cheese.  **2.06/5**
- **Andrew's comments**: Super buttery & smooth compared to other Blues. Salty & funky but not overwhelming. Super tasty, I really like it, & not huge Blue fan generally. Nice with buffalo "chicken", probably great on a burger.  **4.1/5**
