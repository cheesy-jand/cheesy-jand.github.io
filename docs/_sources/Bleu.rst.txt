- **Origin**: Wisconsin
- **Milk**: Cow
- **Purchase location**: Giant
- **Purchase date**: 05/28/22
- **Julie's comments**: Salty, stinky, funky, creamy crumbly white & blue-grey cheese with no rind. Usually not my thing, but this is pretty good with savory foods, less salty chips (cheese itself very salty)  **2.34/5**
- **Andrew's comments**: Salty, funky, creamier than most bleu. Tasty in food (on buffalo chik patties, in stirfry), but ok solo or with chips too. Gets kind of old though, don't want too much of it.  **2.3/5**
- **Thanks to Barb & Rob Necarsulmer for this cheese!**
