- **Style**: Gouda
- **Milk**: Cow
- **Purchase location**: West Chester Food Cupboard
- **Purchase date**: 09/17/22
- **Julie's comments**: Hard tan cheese with a dark blue waxy rind. Nutty, caramelly gouda with salt crystals throughout. Tastes aged, sharper than many goudas. Dries out easily - near rind becomes very hard. Average cheese but very snackable.  **2.82/5**
- **Andrew's comments**: Nutty, caramelly, a bit salty/sweet. Nice Gouda flavor, but not a fan of the gummy texture. Definitely snackable but not remarkable.  **3.0/5**
- **Thanks to Barb & Rob Necarsulmer for this cheese!**
