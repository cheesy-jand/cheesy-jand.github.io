- **Origin**: North Carolina
- **Milk**: Goat
- **Purchase location**: Singing Spring Farm
- **Purchase date**: 08/13/22
- **Julie's comments**: Engagement cheese! Gifted, then bought, from the AirBnB host/farmers where we were engaged! Up front, very salty with a bit of tangy & grassiness from the goat, then still very salty. Needs to be diluted because it's a bit too briny. But it's made locally with love for our love. 5/5 for context.  **2.03/5**
- **Andrew's comments**: Very salty, briny, more so a couple months in. Unfortunately the salt is a bit overwhelmin, but really nice on top of a salad or food where diluted. But also tastes like love, and so cool that they made with goats we met! Infinity/5 for context.  **2.4/5**
