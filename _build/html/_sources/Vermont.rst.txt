- **Style**: Cheddar
- **Milk**: Cow
- **Purchase location**: Weaver Street
- **Purchase date**: 02/20/22
- **Julie's comments**: Raw milk Vermont Cheddar. Off-white, crumbly, extra sharp chaddar that is snackable AF. Creamy when melted, with salty and mildly earthy later notes; a crowd pleaser. Great with chips & salsa, beans (?), also bourbon, maybe a white or fruitier wine.  **3.01/5**
- **Andrew's comments**: Sharp but not overbearing, & quite creamy as well. Medium texture, crumbly, "fudgey". Note the most unique, but gotta like a nice cheddar. Does make me long for the High Plains Cheddar though.  **3.2/5**

- **Style**: Alpine
- **Milk**: Cow
- **Purchase location**: Whole Foods
- **Purchase date**: 07/09/22
- **Julie's comments**: Yellowy tan firm cheese with a crusty rind. Chalky texture a bit, but still kinda smooth. Earthy, very woodsy flavor with a mild sharpness at end. Reminds me of comte.  **2.23/5**
- **Andrew's comments**: Flavor pretty mild, earthy, with some later funk that reminds me of fondue in a way. Chalky texture, not my favorite. Addendum: Not so mild actually, distinctly unlikeable taste (but not terrible).  **1.3/5**

- **Style**: Pepper Jack
- **Milk**: Cow
- **Purchase location**: Unknown
- **Purchase date**: 10/01/21
- **Julie's comments**: Decidedly not spicy! Except for like 3 random bites throughout the whole block. Those spicy bits were good, creamy jack. Disappointing, false advertising.  **0.5/5**
- **Andrew's comments**: Very disappointing, very unspicy, very little flavor. Made a decent quesodilla.  **0.5/5**

- **Style**: Cheddar
- **Milk**: Cow
- **Purchase location**: Weaver Street
- **Purchase date**: 04/15/22
- **Julie's comments**: This is not seriously sharp, unless seriously is less sharp than extra, which seems wrong. Mild cheddar, salty, chewy, kinda creamy. Fine/good on burger or sandwich. Meh alone.  **2.0/5**
- **Andrew's comments**: Semi-creamy, semi-sharp, medium texture. Pretty generic, though very snackable on chips, could eat a lot.  **2.0/5**
