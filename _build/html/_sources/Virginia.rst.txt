- **Julie's comments**: Raw milk cheese, aged 60+ days. Off-yellow firm cheese with a tan brown crumbly rind. Unique flavors - sharp & umami with some funk & also licorice taste. Earthy AF. Pretty smooth texture. I want to like it but also not…  **1.8/5**
- **Andrew's comments**: Very interesting cheese. Texture gradient from smooth medium-hard center to crumbly outer coating. Definitely funky & earthy, with that weirdly pleasant barn floor flavor. Almost too weird, but not quite, I like it.  **3.8/5**

- **Julie's comments**: Yellowy pale, semi soft cheese with a brown & white soft rind. Creamy, rich, funky in that way that goes up your throat/i9nto nose. Not unpleasant, though. Earthy & woodsy, not very salty, probably good on apples & some pepper jelly. Better first day for me.  **3.49/5**
- **Andrew's comments**: Funky, earthy, a bit horseradishy but not spicy (much). Buttery yellow inside, white moldy rind. Texture is sticky, coats your mouth. Not one I'd want a lot of, but very tasty for a couple bites.  **4.1/5**

- **Julie's comments**: Firm yellowy-tan cheese with a flaky, cakey, brown and white rind. Very grassy, a bit staticky/funky taste, especially at the rind. Some nutty and woodsy flavor, some aged Comte vibes. Not a great melty cheese nor is it super snackable…  **1.85/5**
- **Andrew's comments**: Nutty, semi sweet, almost meaty flavor in interior, quite funky/barny rind. Really nice semi firm, smooth, chewy texture. I think this one is quite snackable, at least in center.  **3.9/5**

- **Julie's comments**: Aged over 60 days. This is a funky cheese. Semi soft inside, hard crusty rind. Deep, fatty flavor, that is also kind of fishy? Pork/ham notes, quite umami. Okay on cracker, slightly warmed on a bittery salad.  **1.6/5**
- **Andrew's comments**: Did not like this at first but it has grown on me. Definitely funky with strongish smell and weird mix of textures (soft middle, rubbery outside). But flavor is interesting, with a couple "waves". Somehow the aftertaste reminds me of a barn, more pleasant than it sounds.  **2.1/5**
