Smoked Cheddar (Ayr-Back Farms)
----------------- 
- **Style**: Cheddar
- **Milk**: Cow
- **Purchase location**: Pocopson Meadow Farm store
- **Purchase date**: 12/25/21
- **Julie's comments**: Subtle smoky flavor on top of a mildly sharp cheddar. Creamy, fatty, a bit crumbly. Seems to melt well. Extra nudge on rating for freshness.  **4.01/5**
- **Andrew's comments**: Soft & slightly chewy, slightly crumbly. Pretty mild, somewhat sharp & smoky. Gets extra points based on ambiance & getting to see farm animals. Would probably make a great quesodilla.  **3.0/5**
