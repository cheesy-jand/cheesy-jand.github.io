- **Style**: Tomme
- **Milk**: Cow
- **Purchase location**: Whole Foods
- **Purchase date**: 04/03/22
- **Julie's comments**: Semi-soft tan cheese with sparse holes & a thick bark-like rind with white & brown mold stuff. Middle/inner cheese is nutty, creamy, & subtly funky. Rind/outside is quite funky, earthy, a bit rubbery in texture - but chunky rubber taste/sensation from rind travels up my nose too! Not my fave sensation/taste.  **2.0/5**
- **Andrew's comments**: Inner part is semi-soft, creamy, fairly mild, slightly sour/funky. Rind & outer part is harder, bit rubbery, & quite funky (some hay, some salt, & horseraddish). I like it, int's interesting.  **3.6/5**
