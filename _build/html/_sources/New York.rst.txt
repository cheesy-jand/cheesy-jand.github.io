- **Style**: Cheddar
- **Milk**: Cow
- **Purchase location**: Harris Teater
- **Purchase date**: 05/09/22
- **Julie's comments**: White, firm block of cheddar. Pretty standard sharp cheddar - creamy, salty, a bit of tang. Maybe deserves one of the Xs in XXX sharp. Good with gams/relish. Very snackable, easy to eat.  **3.12/5**
- **Andrew's comments**: Pretty standard white cheddar, agreed. Salty, sharp, with a bit of sour. Even standard cheddar is tasty. Very snackable, especially with spicy relish. Could eat a lot of it.  **2.6/5**
