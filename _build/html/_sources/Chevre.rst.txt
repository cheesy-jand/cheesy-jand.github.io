- **Origin**: Spain
- **Milk**: Goat
- **Purchase location**: Weaver Street
- **Purchase date**: 07/31/22
- **Julie's comments**: Soft, crumbly, white round cheese with classic goat look. Creamy, buttery texture - melts in the mouth. Very rich, tangy & somehow buttery flavor, with a little bit of grass taste too. One of the best goat cheeses I've had I think. So rich, hard to eat a lot.  **4.03/5**
- **Andrew's comments**: Creamy & buttery flavor, melty once the crumbles get in your mouth. Goes through a couple phases, mild goaty/creamy up front, with heavy tang that kicks in later. Benefits a lot from some salt on a chip.  **4.0/5**

Herbed goat cheese log (not sure which one) (Celebrity Dairy)
----------------- 
- **Origin**: North Carolina
- **Milk**: Goat
- **Purchase location**: Carrboro Farmer's Market
- **Purchase date**: 11/15/21
- **Julie's comments**: Goat cheese log that is flavorful inside and out. Coated with herbs, black pepper, salt, but inside also has zest/garlic herb flavor. Creamy, crowd pleaser. Froze to save and still tastes good!  **4.1/5**
- **Andrew's comments**: So delicate & creamy & rich, the cheese melts in your mouth. Salt & herbs on outside are subtle but tasty. Good solo, on chips, on salad, etc.  **4.2/5**
