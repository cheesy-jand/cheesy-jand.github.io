Herbed goat cheese log (not sure which one) (Celebrity Dairy)
----------------- 
- **Origin**: North Carolina
- **Milk**: Goat
- **Purchase location**: Carrboro Farmer's Market
- **Purchase date**: 11/15/21
- **Julie's comments**: Goat cheese log that is flavorful inside and out. Coated with herbs, black pepper, salt, but inside also has zest/garlic herb flavor. Creamy, crowd pleaser. Froze to save and still tastes good!  **4.1/5**
- **Andrew's comments**: So delicate & creamy & rich, the cheese melts in your mouth. Salt & herbs on outside are subtle but tasty. Good solo, on chips, on salad, etc.  **4.2/5**
