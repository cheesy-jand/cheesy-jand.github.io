- **Origin**: Netherlands
- **Milk**: Cow
- **Purchase location**: Whole Foods
- **Purchase date**: 04/03/22
- **Julie's comments**: Yum! Hard tan cheese with white crystals scattered through it, & an orange waxy rind. Tastes quite sharp & aged, like a Pecorino, but has nutty & caramely notes like a Gouda. Dries out a bit with time, but still tasty. So snackable.  **4.57/5**
- **Andrew's comments**: Quite aged, hard cheese with interesting crystals texture inside. Very caramely, semi sharp, nutty, & hint of orange. Tasty but a bit rich for me to have more than a couple pieces. Dried out, eat fast.  **3.8/5**

- **Origin**: Netherlands
- **Milk**: Cow
- **Purchase location**: Weaver Street
- **Purchase date**: 02/20/22
- **Julie's comments**: Tan-orange color with brown waxy rind. Dries out with time. Pretty mild flavor - sharper toward the rind (a bit cheddar like) and then a nutty, mild caramel flavor in the middle. Good with a light red wine, eg Pacific Redwood Organic Pinot 2020.   **3.1/5**
- **Andrew's comments**: Quite tasty, sweet & caramely at first, with more sharp cheddary flavor later. A bit firmer than most Goudas which is nice. Very snackable, nice with salty chip, good pairing with our Pinot Noir with spice flavors.  **3.7/5**

- **Origin**: Netherlands
- **Milk**: Cow
- **Purchase location**: Whole Foods
- **Purchase date**: 10/30/21
- **Julie's comments**: Cantaloupe-colored with black rind, hard/firm. Mix of cheddar & gouda taste, not remarkable but good, melts well. Creamyish, sharp deep flavor, good with spice.  **2.81/5**
- **Andrew's comments**: Agreed, gouda-cheddar hybrid, moderately sharp. Nice semi-crumbly mouthfeel. Very nice with a salty chip, super snackable.  **3.2/5**

Clarina Vintage 36-Month Old Gouda (Artikaas)

- **Origin**: Netherlands
- **Milk**: Cow
- **Purchase location**: Whole Foods
- **Purchase date**: 10/26/22
- **Julie's comments**: Hard pale orange cheese with a orange brown waxy rind. Solid but kind of crumbly texture with some large salty cheese crystals throughout. A salty caramely nutty flavor that is very sharp and aged tasting. Tastes a bit like a Cheddar but also like cheese whiz but in a good way. Pretty snackable, would be great with a good jam and with a red wine. Can't eat a ton at one time because it does dry out the mouth.  **3.74/5**
- **Andrew's comments**: Very sharp, a bit Cheddary but definitely has that aged Gouda caramely nutty taste going on. A bit of leathery or tobacco-y flavor in there too which is interesting. Would go well with jam or Bourbon. Texture is a bit gummy and chalky which isn't my favorite but has some nice crystals. It's probably too sharp for me to want much in a row, but very nice addition to a diverse cheese board.  **3.7/5**

Comtesse Gouda (Brugge)

- **Origin**: Belgium
- **Milk**: Cow
- **Purchase location**: West Chester Food Cupboard
- **Purchase date**: 09/17/22
- **Julie's comments**: Hard tan cheese with a dark blue waxy rind. Nutty, caramelly gouda with salt crystals throughout. Tastes aged, sharper than many goudas. Dries out easily - near rind becomes very hard. Average cheese but very snackable.  **2.82/5**
- **Andrew's comments**: Nutty, caramelly, a bit salty/sweet. Nice Gouda flavor, but not a fan of the gummy texture. Definitely snackable but not remarkable.  **3.0/5**
- **Thanks to Barb & Rob Necarsulmer for this cheese!**

Estate Gouda (Murray's Cheese)

- **Origin**: Netherlands
- **Milk**: Cow
- **Purchase location**: Murray's Cheese
- **Purchase date**: 01/14/22
- **Julie's comments**: Pale yellow firm cheese that gets slightly darker at the rind - brown waxy rind. Nutty, caramely, woodsy flavor. Melts in the mouth & on a savory smoky food. Does dry out a bit with time.  **3.84/5**
- **Andrew's comments**: Firm near rind, softer & a bit less pleasant (kind of American cheesy) in terms of texture near center. Rich, earthy, "cool" taste, with caramel & nuttiness. Intersting flavor, especially closer to rind. Would give a bit higher rating near rind (4.1), and lower near center (2.5)  **3.3/5**
- **Thanks to Tim & Abigail Necarsulmer for this cheese!**

- **Andrew's comments**: Great cheese, similar to white cheddar but not too sharp, more nutty. Nice goaty crumbly mouth feel.  **4.1/5**

- **Andrew's comments**: Interesting nutty flavor, somewhat Parmesany texture. I like it but nothing spectacular in my opinion (sorry J)  **3.1/5**

- **Julie's comments**: Pale tan cheese with a creamy firm center that gets darker toward the black waxy rind. Nutty, creamy, slightly caramely cheese that pairs well with anything. Kind of Gouda-like, a hint of butter/oak. Very snackable.  **4.43/5**
- **Andrew's comments**: Nutty & quite milky flavored. Semi-hard, crumbly texture. I want to like this one, it seems like a nice cheese, but just doesn't do much for me, kind of boring. Sorry!  **2.4/5**
- **Thanks to Samantha Tulenko for this cheese!**

Robusto Gouda (Kaasiaggio)

- **Origin**: Netherlands
- **Milk**: Cow
- **Purchase location**: Whole Foods
- **Purchase date**: 10/30/21
- **Julie's comments**: Tan, firm cheese with red/orange rind. Quite aged, so nutty and sharp with a mild funky after taste. Salty! Good with rackers and a spread or with salad, pasta! Better fresh, dries quickly.  **3.12/5**
- **Andrew's comments**: Hard cheese, much closer to Parmesan flavor/texture than traditional Gouda. Has crystals that look like mold (but not). Pretty forgettable honestly, middle of road.  **2.3/5**

- **Purchase location**: Weaver Street
- **Purchase date**: 07/23/22
- **Julie's comments**: Firm, tan-yellow cheese with slightly darker yellow-brown thin rind. Gummy, creamy texture. Nutty, buttery flavor with smokiness later - subtle umami, not overpowering smoke. Could mindlessly eat half a block - not thrilling but quite snackable.  **3.23/5**
- **Andrew's comments**: Nice smoky smell, semi-smoky taste with creamy nuttiness. Gummy texture, reminds me of cheap processed cheese like Monterrey Jack, not my favorite. Definitely snackable, trail vibes. Very tasty with hummus.  **2.4/5**
