- **Origin**: North Carolina
- **Milk**: Cow
- **Purchase location**: Weaver Street
- **Purchase date**: 05/28/22
- **Julie's comments**: Pale orange firm cheese with a thin brown rind. Very nutty and tangy with a hint of caramel. Tastes like a Gouda and a Parmesan had a cheese baby. Creamy, versatile, snackable - I could eat a block of this. Note: rind = not tasty.  **3.09/5**
- **Andrew's comments**: Nutty & caramely, agree on Gouda/Parmesan flavor. It's supposed to be asiago style, but not great resemblance - may have been close before drying out. Kind of gummy texture, not my favorite. Inner part better than rind.  **2.7/5**
