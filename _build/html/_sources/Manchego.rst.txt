- **Origin**: Spain
- **Milk**: Sheep
- **Purchase location**: Weaver Street
- **Purchase date**: 10/01/22
- **Julie's comments**: Pale tan firm with classic striped brown/purple rind. Nutty, salty, buttery cheese, a bit of caramel aftertaste, but also meaty? Very snackable - not an excellent Manchego (2.0/5), but still very tasty in general.  **3.92/5**
- **Andrew's comments**: Salty, buttery, tangy, bright, and semi sharp. Sort of firm, a bit crumbly. So snackable, could (no, did) eat a lot of this.  **3.9/5**

- **Origin**: Spain
- **Milk**: Sheep
- **Purchase location**: Trader Joe's
- **Purchase date**: 10/15/22
- **Julie's comments**: Tan offwhite firm cheese with a stripy red waxy rind. Kind of crumbly texture. Buttery grassy taste, a little bit of nuttiness as well. Not the best Manchego I've ever had but it is incredibly snackable and I could eat a whole block in one sitting if I didn't throw up first.  **3.78/5**
- **Andrew's comments**: Has that classic tangy, milky Manchego taste, with a bit of grassiness on the finish. Crumbly chewy texture, with waxy rind adding nice bit of firmness. This one has dried out a bit since we got it. Not the peak Manchego but still very snackable.  **3.5/5**
