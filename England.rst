- **Style**: Flavored
- **Milk**: Cow
- **Purchase location**: Whole Foods
- **Purchase date**: 05/02/22
- **Julie's comments**: Thick waxy purple rind, pale purple crumbly interior with small dried cranberries. Dessert cheese - sweet but not overly so (not syrupy). Crumbles in mouth, creamy with texture from cranberry chunks. Mild, yogurty flavor - many Thanksgiving vibes. Tasty when mood right.  **3.69/5**
- **Andrew's comments**: Tastes like a relatively unsweet cheesecake, texture as well. Cranberry is nice, not too strong. Cheese itself is Gouda-y or Cheddary, nothing too special. Dessert or cheese/fruit plate cheese, not ideal for mid dinner snacking.  **2.9/5**

- **Julie's comments**: Waxy, gummy, strong chives, semi soft, creamy. Not my favorite, but would try a non-flavored variety.  **1.0/5**
- **Andrew's comments**: This reminded me of the cheese between crackers in those snacks. Felt overprocessed and a bit weird, but honestly sort of tasty?  **2.1/5**

Keens Farmhouse Cheddar (Neals Yard)

- **Style**: Cheddar
- **Milk**: Cow
- **Purchase location**: Whole Foods
- **Purchase date**: 05/15/22
- **Julie's comments**: Looks like a standard white cheddar, but I would not have guessed it was a cheddar by taste. Smooth, gummy texture. Not very crumbly, salty and tangy flavor, with a sharp sour feeling that lingers at the end. At first I really didn't like it, but it has grown on me. Pair with crackers or a jam (not a spicy one)...hmm...  **2.29/5**
- **Andrew's comments**: Not the most cheddary, semi-sharp. Kind of tangy and a bit of licorice? And a bit of almost fermented taste that reminds me of the Caciacavallo. Smooth texture with small grains. Overall interesting but not the best.  **2.1/5**

- **Julie's comments**: Bright orange firm aged cheese with a thin waxy rind. Mild flavor - nutty, a bit of sweetness, very earthy taste - kind of like a more mellow cheddar & some dirt. Decent, but not thrilling. Probably would be good melted on a burger.  **2.4/5**
- **Andrew's comments**: A bit sharp, a bit nutty, a bit earthy. Strange after taste. Hard, a bit crumbly, gritty.  **1.8/5**
