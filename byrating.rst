- **Andrew's comments**: A top tier cheese to be sure. Very buttery and nice semi squishy texture, kind of like a butter & paneer baby (but better than that sounds). Great with salty tortilla chips.  **4.7/5**

----------------- 
- **Style**: Other
- **Origin**: North Carolina
- **Milk**: Goat
- **Purchase location**: Weaver Street
- **Purchase date**: 03/26/22
- **Julie's comments**: Soft white cheese with crumbly white center, off-white creamy outer layer, & classic white textured rind. Tangy, salty chevre-like interior, then creamy buttery Brie-like outer layer. Mild funk especially in creamy part, which I like less. Has metallic after taste. Overall I like a lot, surprisingly. So good with pepper jelly.  **4.39/5**
- **Andrew's comments**: So good & unique. Super creamy, texture in between chevre & Brie. Also has tangy flavor, lemony, some bites even remind me of lemon bar (cheesecake version), but not sweet. Semi salty & nic, mild funk. Agreed about pepper jelly.  **4.85/5**

- **Andrew's comments**: Honestly such a strange cheese… very confusing taste, but it has grown on me and I love it. Salty and meaty, texture a bit like jerky especially near rind. Would probably go great with charcuterie if that's your thing. Also kind of sour, vaguely like kimchi? Extremely snackable, especially with chip to take the edge off. Very unique.  **4.69/5**
- **Thanks to Giulia Fragola for this cheese!**

- **Andrew's comments**: Quite aged, hard cheese with interesting crystals texture inside. Very caramely, semi sharp, nutty, & hint of orange. Tasty but a bit rich for me to have more than a couple pieces. Dried out, eat fast.  **3.8/5**

- **Origin**: Wisconsin
- **Milk**: Goat + Sheep
- **Purchase location**: Whole Foods
- **Purchase date**: 07/09/22
- **Julie's comments**: Layered off white cheese, bottom layer light color, thin blue/brown line, then speckled tan - firmish, no rind. Creamy, tangy goat-cheese-like flavor - light, a bit buttery on tan side (but both sides taste very similar). Like cheddar & goat & Manchego.  **4.01/5**
- **Andrew's comments**: Interesting look, not much variation in taste despite line through middle. Sharp, creamy, a bit tangy. Quite a bit like sharp white cheddar, but a bit fuller flavor profile. Super snackable, could eat a lot of this. Not the most unique but solid choice for spread.  **3.5/5**

- **Origin**: Spain
- **Milk**: Sheep
- **Purchase location**: Whole Foods
- **Purchase date**: 05/15/22
- **Julie's comments**: Off white firm cheese with thin patterned red-brown rind. Creamy, milky, mildly tangy/yogurty flavor. A bit grassy, chalky in a good way, also has tastes of sliced American cheese, but only the good part of that. Versatile, snackable, but not a standout. Lasts long! Cool.  **3.23/5**
- **Andrew's comments**: Salty, creamy, tangy, semi-sharp. True, a hint of American cheese vibe, but very tasty. Nice semi-firm texture, with some subtle gritty "sparkles", and I like the grooves on rind. Very snackable, and would make amazing grilled cheese/mac & cheese.  **4.1/5**

- **Andrew's comments**: Quite rich and creamy, soft but "sticker" texture than other Taleggio. I wish it had a firmer rind like the other. Tastes fairly funky and quite salty. Feels a bit one dimensional compared to the other Taleggio.  **2.7/5**
- **Thanks to Giulia Fragola for this cheese!**

- **Origin**: Italy
- **Milk**: Cow
- **Purchase location**: Weaver Street
- **Purchase date**: 03/07/22
- **Julie's comments**: Raw cow milk, sea salt, thistle flowers. A unique cheese - white, firm, tan waxy rind. Very mild tangy funk up front, then salty, some grassy butter taste. Tasted some floral notes when first opened, but not by day 3. Quite pleasing.  **3.92/5**
- **Andrew's comments**: I go back & forth on this one, not sure if it's different parts of the cheese, or just different nights & moods. At its best, it's buttery/creamy, tangy, unique flavor. Nice semi-hard texture. At less inspired moments it reminds me of generic white cheddar.  **3.3/5**

- **Andrew's comments**: Hard yellow cheese with interesting granules adding texture. Dried out a bit since we got it. Nutty, salty-sweet, & smoky/spicy (mild) after taste. Semi-funky rind. Great on its own, with chips, or with pepper jelly.  **4.3/5**

- **Origin**: Netherlands
- **Milk**: Cow
- **Purchase location**: Murray's Cheese
- **Purchase date**: 01/14/22
- **Julie's comments**: Pale yellow firm cheese that gets slightly darker at the rind - brown waxy rind. Nutty, caramely, woodsy flavor. Melts in the mouth & on a savory smoky food. Does dry out a bit with time.  **3.84/5**
- **Andrew's comments**: Firm near rind, softer & a bit less pleasant (kind of American cheesy) in terms of texture near center. Rich, earthy, "cool" taste, with caramel & nuttiness. Intersting flavor, especially closer to rind. Would give a bit higher rating near rind (4.1), and lower near center (2.5)  **3.3/5**
- **Thanks to Tim & Abigail Necarsulmer for this cheese!**

- **Julie's comments**: Soft off-white cheese with white & tan chalky rind. Brie-like - buttery, rich, creamy interior with mild, salty taste and slight funk that tingles the very back of mouth. Like creamy salted butter that went bad yesterday, but not necessarily in a bad way.  **3.21/5**
- **Andrew's comments**: Extra soft gooey center, pleasingly oily & melts in your mouth. Then outer rind gives just enough texture. Nice creamy brie-like flavor, fairly mild especially upfront. Some salty funk comes in later.  **3.8/5**

----------------- 
- **Style**: Cheddar
- **Origin**: Pennsylvania
- **Milk**: Cow
- **Purchase location**: Pocopson Meadow Farm store
- **Purchase date**: 12/25/21
- **Julie's comments**: Subtle smoky flavor on top of a mildly sharp cheddar. Creamy, fatty, a bit crumbly. Seems to melt well. Extra nudge on rating for freshness.  **4.01/5**
- **Andrew's comments**: Soft & slightly chewy, slightly crumbly. Pretty mild, somewhat sharp & smoky. Gets extra points based on ambiance & getting to see farm animals. Would probably make a great quesodilla.  **3.0/5**

- **Style**: Gouda
- **Origin**: Netherlands
- **Milk**: Goat
- **Purchase location**: Unknown
- **Purchase date**: 05/15/22
- **Julie's comments**: Pale tan cheese with a creamy firm center that gets darker toward the black waxy rind. Nutty, creamy, slightly caramely cheese that pairs well with anything. Kind of Gouda-like, a hint of butter/oak. Very snackable.  **4.43/5**
- **Andrew's comments**: Nutty & quite milky flavored. Semi-hard, crumbly texture. I want to like this one, it seems like a nice cheese, but just doesn't do much for me, kind of boring. Sorry!  **2.4/5**
- **Thanks to Samantha Tulenko for this cheese!**

- **Origin**: Netherlands
- **Milk**: Cow
- **Purchase location**: Weaver Street
- **Purchase date**: 02/20/22
- **Julie's comments**: Tan-orange color with brown waxy rind. Dries out with time. Pretty mild flavor - sharper toward the rind (a bit cheddar like) and then a nutty, mild caramel flavor in the middle. Good with a light red wine, eg Pacific Redwood Organic Pinot 2020.   **3.1/5**
- **Andrew's comments**: Quite tasty, sweet & caramely at first, with more sharp cheddary flavor later. A bit firmer than most Goudas which is nice. Very snackable, nice with salty chip, good pairing with our Pinot Noir with spice flavors.  **3.7/5**

- **Purchase location**: Wegmans
- **Purchase date**: 12/25/21
- **Julie's comments**: Funky, stinky, smokey-ish cheese. Staticky after taste. Creamy center with thick, white/green rind, salty. Liked on day 1, but less so on day 2. I am conflicted. Would probably like more on a burger or something.  **3.2/5**
- **Andrew's comments**: Very soft and creamy, funky taste, bleu-ish flavor. Interesting texture, different parts are gooey/chewy. Similar to Leonara, but not as good.  **3.5/5**
- **Thanks to Barb & Rob Necarsulmer for this cheese!**

- **Style**: Flavored
- **Origin**: England
- **Milk**: Cow
- **Purchase location**: Whole Foods
- **Purchase date**: 05/02/22
- **Julie's comments**: Thick waxy purple rind, pale purple crumbly interior with small dried cranberries. Dessert cheese - sweet but not overly so (not syrupy). Crumbles in mouth, creamy with texture from cranberry chunks. Mild, yogurty flavor - many Thanksgiving vibes. Tasty when mood right.  **3.69/5**
- **Andrew's comments**: Tastes like a relatively unsweet cheesecake, texture as well. Cranberry is nice, not too strong. Cheese itself is Gouda-y or Cheddary, nothing too special. Dessert or cheese/fruit plate cheese, not ideal for mid dinner snacking.  **2.9/5**

- **Origin**: Italy
- **Milk**: Cow
- **Purchase location**: Unknown
- **Purchase date**: 01/09/22
- **Julie's comments**: Sharp, salty, tangy, SHARP cheese, with nutty undertones. Great with a zesty pasta sauce and an Italian red wine. Firm, dense, and layered/stringy texture with flavor that lingers. Stands well alone.  **3.96/5**
- **Andrew's comments**: Sharp and salty, tastes a bit like the Pecorino Romano I think, but more subtle. Crumbly texture, slightly grainy. Pretty good, but not super memorable.  **2.6/5**
- **Thanks to Giulia Fragola for this cheese!**

- **Style**: Taleggio
- **Origin**: Italy
- **Milk**: Cow
- **Purchase location**: Weaver Street
- **Purchase date**: 01/08/22
- **Julie's comments**: A creamy, funky, salty cheese with a soft interior and crusty exterior. Has a special blue-green "cat fur" (or something) mold on outside. Grew on me but not my favorite. Maybe needs a fig jam or something?  **2.5/5**
- **Andrew's comments**: Very creamy, soft buttery texture. A bit of funk but fairly subtle. Really nice on salty chip.  **3.9/5**

- **Origin**: Italy

- **Purchase location**: Harris Teater
- **Purchase date**: 04/20/22
- **Julie's comments**: Pale, off-white hard aged cheese with some white crystals through interior. Very nutty, a bit woodsy, with a slight caramel after taste, kind of Pecorino-like. Very snackable, will dry out with time. *Note: rated whilst COVID infected, taste mostly unaffected  **3.74/5**
- **Andrew's comments**: Interior of cheese is salty, umami, a bit sour/citrusy & nutty. Between a Pecorino Romano & Caciacavallo. Near the rind is hard & rubbery & less flavorful, maybe ours dried out. Rated 3.6 interior, 1.5 exterior.  **2.6/5**

- **Purchase location**: Whole Foods
- **Purchase date**: 03/26/22
- **Julie's comments**: Pale white cheese with dusty, 2mm thick purple-black rind. Cheese is creamy, buttery, garlicky - very truffle-like. Sweet undernotes, but mostly strong truffle flavor overpowers. Rind is gritty, but I don't hate it. Very snackable, but rich so I eat/want less.  **3.01/5**
- **Andrew's comments**: Very truffly & garlicky, tastes more like an hors d'oeuvres than just cheese. The underlying cheese is creamy though unremarkable, but truffle flavor dominates. Snackable on its own, very nice with naan, probably other bread.  **3.3/5**

- **Style**: Cheddar
- **Origin**: Vermont
- **Milk**: Cow
- **Purchase location**: Weaver Street
- **Purchase date**: 02/20/22
- **Julie's comments**: Raw milk Vermont Cheddar. Off-white, crumbly, extra sharp chaddar that is snackable AF. Creamy when melted, with salty and mildly earthy later notes; a crowd pleaser. Great with chips & salsa, beans (?), also bourbon, maybe a white or fruitier wine.  **3.01/5**
- **Andrew's comments**: Sharp but not overbearing, & quite creamy as well. Medium texture, crumbly, "fudgey". Note the most unique, but gotta like a nice cheddar. Does make me long for the High Plains Cheddar though.  **3.2/5**

- **Milk**: Cow
- **Purchase location**: Whole Foods
- **Purchase date**: 07/09/22
- **Julie's comments**: Yellowy firm cheese with a bleu-ish mottled line in the middle & a maxy tan rind. Tastes like fake butter, but too much, and fake onion slightly. Creamy, fatty taste, also a bit sweet. Tastes processed but doesn't feel processed? I think it's the over the top butter...  **2.15/5**
- **Andrew's comments**: Sue me, I like butter! Tasty, buttery, tangy, with a tiny bit of farmy aftertaste. Interesting texture, semi chewy inside, bit harder rind. Super snackable solo, would also be great grated over pasta.  **4.0/5**

- **Andrew's comments**: Agreed, gouda-cheddar hybrid, moderately sharp. Nice semi-crumbly mouthfeel. Very nice with a salty chip, super snackable.  **3.2/5**

- **Purchase location**: Whole Foods
- **Purchase date**: 07/09/22
- **Julie's comments**: Semi firm/kinda soft tan cheese with a brown crusty rind. Creamy but firm texture. Salty & sheep/funky up front but pretty mellow. Rind is dirt-like and not my fave, but isn't bad. Solid mildly funky cheese.  **3.19/5**
- **Andrew's comments**: Soft center with gritty-but-in-a-pleasing-way rind, nice texture. Salty, semi-funky rind but mildish center. A bit sweet even. Hard to rate, interesting but also a bit boring simultaneously.  **2.8/5**

- **Milk**: Cow
- **Purchase location**: Weaver Street
- **Purchase date**: 05/28/22
- **Julie's comments**: Pale orange firm cheese with a thin brown rind. Very nutty and tangy with a hint of caramel. Tastes like a Gouda and a Parmesan had a cheese baby. Creamy, versatile, snackable - I could eat a block of this. Note: rind = not tasty.  **3.09/5**
- **Andrew's comments**: Nutty & caramely, agree on Gouda/Parmesan flavor. It's supposed to be asiago style, but not great resemblance - may have been close before drying out. Kind of gummy texture, not my favorite. Inner part better than rind.  **2.7/5**

- **Andrew's comments**: Gouda-like at center, nutty & caramely, soft texture not my favorite, but flavor is nice though mild. Harder near rind, nicer texture. Dried out a bit, trying to remember initial impressions.  **2.7/5**

- **Milk**: Cow
- **Purchase location**: Harris Teater
- **Purchase date**: 05/09/22
- **Julie's comments**: White, firm block of cheddar. Pretty standard sharp cheddar - creamy, salty, a bit of tang. Maybe deserves one of the Xs in XXX sharp. Good with gams/relish. Very snackable, easy to eat.  **3.12/5**
- **Andrew's comments**: Pretty standard white cheddar, agreed. Salty, sharp, with a bit of sour. Even standard cheddar is tasty. Very snackable, especially with spicy relish. Could eat a lot of it.  **2.6/5**

- **Style**: Other
- **Origin**: North Carolina
- **Milk**: Cow
- **Purchase location**: Weaver Street
- **Purchase date**: 03/19/22
- **Julie's comments**: Funky AF, mild stinky cheese - gray ashy rind, creamy/gooey under rind, then soft crumbly white interior. The gooey part has brie-like flavor - tangy, funky, creamy. Center is more funky, kind of sour, earthy. Rind is deep, earthy, sooty. Good with strawberry habenero jam. Tough to rate.  **2.0/5**
- **Andrew's comments**: Truly strange & unique cheese, different flavors come in waves. Funky, stinky rind, then gooey, slimy layer, then soft chevre-like texture. Creamy Brie flavor up front, then earthier barny flavors, then smokey finish. I have to rate higher than pure enjoyment out of sheer uniqueness.  **3.7/5**

- **Purchase location**: Whole Foods
- **Purchase date**: 04/03/22
- **Julie's comments**: Semi-soft tan cheese with sparse holes & a thick bark-like rind with white & brown mold stuff. Middle/inner cheese is nutty, creamy, & subtly funky. Rind/outside is quite funky, earthy, a bit rubbery in texture - but chunky rubber taste/sensation from rind travels up my nose too! Not my fave sensation/taste.  **2.0/5**
- **Andrew's comments**: Inner part is semi-soft, creamy, fairly mild, slightly sour/funky. Rind & outer part is harder, bit rubbery, & quite funky (some hay, some salt, & horseraddish). I like it, int's interesting.  **3.6/5**

- **Julie's comments**: Raw milk cheese, aged 60+ days. Off-yellow firm cheese with a tan brown crumbly rind. Unique flavors - sharp & umami with some funk & also licorice taste. Earthy AF. Pretty smooth texture. I want to like it but also not…  **1.8/5**
- **Andrew's comments**: Very interesting cheese. Texture gradient from smooth medium-hard center to crumbly outer coating. Definitely funky & earthy, with that weirdly pleasant barn floor flavor. Almost too weird, but not quite, I like it.  **3.8/5**

- **Julie's comments**: Tan, aged cheese with a thin rind, quite firm. Not a ton of flavor, a bit dry (may have not wrapped it properly?). Needs a jam or something to jazz it up. Overall just ok. Smells like hay.  **2.11/5**
- **Andrew's comments**: Very earthy, actually kind of smells/tastes a bit like a barn, but in a pleasant way (if slightly offputting). Nutty & a bit of caramel. Firm texture & somewhat crumbly.  **3.4/5**
- **Thanks to Tim & Abigail Necarsulmer for this cheese!**

- **Andrew's comments**: Hard cheese, much closer to Parmesan flavor/texture than traditional Gouda. Has crystals that look like mold (but not). Pretty forgettable honestly, middle of road.  **2.3/5**

- **Julie's comments**: So many Pecorinos! Firm, off-white cheese. Small crumble to it. Very salty tey also creamy, needs balance. Good but not as tasty as Pecorino Toscano. A simpler flavor, seems to have salt crystals in it.  **2.6/5**
- **Andrew's comments**: Very salty & umami, more oily than creamy. Seems like it would be great over pasta, especially pesto. A bit too salty solo.  **2.6/5**

- **Julie's comments**: Mild, soft but not oozy-soft Brie with classic appearance. Creamy but not overwhelmingly so. Rind a bit hard and bitter or dirty-tasting. Overall pretty meh but I don't hate it, which is an improvement for me and Brie I guess.  **2.02/5**
- **Andrew's comments**: Nice classic Brie, a bit creamy, a bit funky, but not too much. Pretty standard for  Brie, but I like Brie. Was better the first couple of days, feels like it lost a bit of flavor.  **3.1/5**

- **Julie's comments**: Wine flavor & smell up front with the purple rind. Creamy, very smooth firm center - nutty and earthy, not salty, quite mild. I was expecting a sharper cheese, but this is creamier with a teeeeny funk at the end. Sadly a bit underwhelming without a glass of wine to accompany.  **2.51/5**
- **Andrew's comments**: Cheese is creamy, milky, Nice but not the most exciting. Medium crumbly/chewy texture. The wine rine is tasty but very subtle, I wish it was more forward.  **2.4/5**

- **Andrew's comments**: Salty, funky, creamier than most bleu. Tasty in food (on buffalo chik patties, in stirfry), but ok solo or with chips too. Gets kind of old though, don't want too much of it.  **2.3/5**

- **Julie's comments**: This one has some funk! Salty, umami, with a lot of creamy and a bit of tang. Firm, soft texture (not crumbly) that melts in the mouth. Original taste, different from other pecorinos. Polarizing, I go back and forth.  **2.4/5**
- **Andrew's comments**: A bit funky, nutty, umami. Medium firmness, nice texture with harder rind. I keep going back and forth on this one bite to bite. Addendum: After another couple of days I'm back to liking this less.  **2.2/5**
- **Thanks to Giulia Fragola for this cheese!**

- **Style**: Gruyere
- **Origin**: Switzerland
- **Milk**: Cow
- **Purchase location**: Weaver Street
- **Purchase date**: 07/10/22
- **Julie's comments**: Tan cheese, firm, with a brown crusty, crumbly rind. Salty, tangy, grassy, a bit cattle-y? In a nice way. Like comte and also a little cheddar vibes, rind is funky. Creamy, gummy texture. Would be good with jam or pepper jelly.  **2.95/5**
- **Andrew's comments**: Barny, tangy flavor, reminds me of raclette (the cheese, not act), or even fondue flavor. Not my favorite. Texture is a bit gummy, flavor sticks in mouth a while.  **1.6/5**

Keens Farmhouse Cheddar (Neals Yard)
-----------------

- **Style**: Cheddar
- **Origin**: England
- **Milk**: Cow
- **Purchase location**: Whole Foods
- **Purchase date**: 05/15/22
- **Julie's comments**: Looks like a standard white cheddar, but I would not have guessed it was a cheddar by taste. Smooth, gummy texture. Not very crumbly, salty and tangy flavor, with a sharp sour feeling that lingers at the end. At first I really didn't like it, but it has grown on me. Pair with crackers or a jam (not a spicy one)...hmm...  **2.29/5**
- **Andrew's comments**: Not the most cheddary, semi-sharp. Kind of tangy and a bit of licorice? And a bit of almost fermented taste that reminds me of the Caciacavallo. Smooth texture with small grains. Overall interesting but not the best.  **2.1/5**

Pleasant Ridge Reserve (Uplands Cheese Company)

- **Style**: Alpine
- **Origin**: Wisconsin
- **Milk**: Cow
- **Purchase location**: Whole Foods
- **Purchase date**: 04/06/22
- **Julie's comments**: Tan firm cheese that gets slightly darker towards the thin waxy rind. Subtle flavor - grassy and a bit tangy. Texture is a bit gritty/crumbly - not excellent. Pretty boring - needs a jam or something - or grilling!  **2.25/5**
- **Andrew's comments**: Flavor is unusual, if subtle and a bit boring. Can't figure out exactly what uniqueness is. Maybe cottage cheese? With a bit of sweetness. Semi-firm texture, bit of grit.  **2.0/5**

- **Purchase date**: 03/26/22
- **Julie's comments**: Bright orange firm aged cheese with a thin waxy rind. Mild flavor - nutty, a bit of sweetness, very earthy taste - kind of like a more mellow cheddar & some dirt. Decent, but not thrilling. Probably would be good melted on a burger.  **2.4/5**
- **Andrew's comments**: A bit sharp, a bit nutty, a bit earthy. Strange after taste. Hard, a bit crumbly, gritty.  **1.8/5**

- **Julie's comments**: Dry, hard, a little like Parmesan, but less nutty. A bit bitter? Not melty.  **2.3/5**
- **Andrew's comments**: Dry and a little crumbly mouth feel. Agreed Parmesany, but less flavorful slightly. Probably good on top of food? But kind of boring as standalone cheese.  **1.8/5**

Vermont Seriously Sharp White Cheddar (Cabot)
-----------------

- **Style**: Cheddar
- **Origin**: Vermont
- **Milk**: Cow
- **Purchase location**: Weaver Street
- **Purchase date**: 04/15/22
- **Julie's comments**: This is not seriously sharp, unless seriously is less sharp than extra, which seems wrong. Mild cheddar, salty, chewy, kinda creamy. Fine/good on burger or sandwich. Meh alone.  **2.0/5**
- **Andrew's comments**: Semi-creamy, semi-sharp, medium texture. Pretty generic, though very snackable on chips, could eat a lot.  **2.0/5**

- **Style**: Other
- **Origin**: Virginia
- **Milk**: Cow
- **Purchase location**: Weaver Street
- **Purchase date**: 08/01/21
- **Julie's comments**: Aged over 60 days. This is a funky cheese. Semi soft inside, hard crusty rind. Deep, fatty flavor, that is also kind of fishy? Pork/ham notes, quite umami. Okay on cracker, slightly warmed on a bittery salad.  **1.6/5**
- **Andrew's comments**: Did not like this at first but it has grown on me. Definitely funky with strongish smell and weird mix of textures (soft middle, rubbery outside). But flavor is interesting, with a couple "waves". Somehow the aftertaste reminds me of a barn, more pleasant than it sounds.  **2.1/5**

Alpha Tolman (Jasper Hill Farm)

- **Style**: Alpine

- **Purchase location**: Whole Foods
- **Purchase date**: 07/09/22
- **Julie's comments**: Yellowy tan firm cheese with a crusty rind. Chalky texture a bit, but still kinda smooth. Earthy, very woodsy flavor with a mild sharpness at end. Reminds me of comte.  **2.23/5**
- **Andrew's comments**: Flavor pretty mild, earthy, with some later funk that reminds me of fondue in a way. Chalky texture, not my favorite. Addendum: Not so mild actually, distinctly unlikeable taste (but not terrible).  **1.3/5**

Cheddar Infused with Basil Hayden's Bourbon (Beehive Cheese)

- **Style**: Cheddar
- **Origin**: Utah
- **Milk**: Cow
- **Purchase location**: Harris Teater
- **Purchase date**: 02/23/22
- **Julie's comments**: Tan firm cheese, no rind. Caramel notes upfront, with a mild salty/acidic tang later, melts well. Tastes like a mild cheddar with a hint of booze. Best with bourbon, meh alone.  **1.98/5**
- **Andrew's comments**: Fairly mild, a bit sharp like white cheddar. I don't really taste the bourbon, except maybe slightly at rind. Very forgettable honestly.  **1.3/5**

- **Julie's comments**: Waxy, gummy, strong chives, semi soft, creamy. Not my favorite, but would try a non-flavored variety.  **1.0/5**
- **Andrew's comments**: This reminded me of the cheese between crackers in those snacks. Felt overprocessed and a bit weird, but honestly sort of tasty?  **2.1/5**

Swiss Raclette (Emmi)

- **Purchase date**: 03/26/22
- **Julie's comments**: Firm off white/yellowish cheese with a thin speckled white rind. Mild, nutty, earthy slightly sharp flavor, a bit sweet. Gummy/sticky/thick texture. Needs melting/toasting or something. Would be good raclette. Underwhelming, but not bad.  **1.6/5**
- **Andrew's comments**: Mild, slightly sharp white cheese. Chewy/gooey, sort of unpleasant texture. Agreed, might be better melty, but pretty boring elsewise.  **1.4/5**

Tomme de Savoie (Herve Mons)

- **Style**: Tomme
- **Origin**: France
- **Milk**: Cow
- **Purchase location**: Whole Foods
- **Purchase date**: 04/03/22
- **Julie's comments**: Yellow/tan semi firm cheese with a brown bark-like rind. Funky, mushroomy, staticky flavor that hits the back of my throat & up the sinuses. Gummy, fatty/sticky texture. Flaky rind. This is so bizarre… not bad but not my favorite  **1.4/5**
- **Andrew's comments**: Very unique flavor (but not necessarily positive). Earthy, mushroomy, strange. Some hay. Semi-crunchy/flaky texture on rind, gummy interior. It dried out, earlier the inside was gooey & slimy, both options rather weird.  **1.5/5**

- **Style**: Vegan
- **Origin**: Greece
- **Milk**: Vegan
- **Purchase location**: Unknown
- **Purchase date**: 09/01/21
- **Julie's comments**: Does not taste just like parmesan, unfortunately. Hard, a bit grainy, starchy. Similar flavor to nutritional yeast - umami, salty. Performed okay blended into pesto. By itself, icky - mixed in with stuff, ok.  **0.8/5**
- **Andrew's comments**: Yeah definitely not parmesan… tastes a little more similar when dusted, but eating a chunk is unpleasant texture & salty taste that isn't super cheesy.  **0.6/5**

- **Julie's comments**: Decidedly not spicy! Except for like 3 random bites throughout the whole block. Those spicy bits were good, creamy jack. Disappointing, false advertising.  **0.5/5**
- **Andrew's comments**: Very disappointing, very unspicy, very little flavor. Made a decent quesodilla.  **0.5/5**
