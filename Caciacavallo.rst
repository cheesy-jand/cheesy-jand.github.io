- **Origin**: Italy
- **Milk**: Unknown
- **Purchase location**: Julia's Uncle
- **Purchase date**: 01/09/22
- **Julie's comments**: Shaped like a bell with a top knob thing. Tan with a layered waxy rind. Salty, dry, umami. Tastes remarkably like salami - aged, meaty. Most unique cheese thus far for me - addictive.   **4.39/5**
- **Andrew's comments**: Honestly such a strange cheeseâ€¦ very confusing taste, but it has grown on me and I love it. Salty and meaty, texture a bit like jerky especially near rind. Would probably go great with charcuterie if that's your thing. Also kind of sour, vaguely like kimchi? Extremely snackable, especially with chip to take the edge off. Very unique.  **4.69/5**
- **Thanks to Giulia Fragola for this cheese!**
