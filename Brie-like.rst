- **Origin**: North Carolina
- **Milk**: Cow
- **Purchase location**: Carrboro Farmer's Market
- **Purchase date**: 12/11/21
- **Julie's comments**: White rind with slightly yellow soft interior. Very rich, creamy, buttery - a bit too much for me. Like a brie, but stronger, a bit more buttery & a bit of funk. I respect it, but this isn't my favorite style of cheese.  **3.06/5**
- **Andrew's comments**: Rich & buttery, a bit funky but not too much. Soft center, firmer/chewy rind. I love this cheese, I could eat a whole wheel of this and a baguette for dinner.  **4.6/5**

Coppinger (Sequatchie Cove)

- **Origin**: Tennessee
- **Milk**: Cow
- **Purchase location**: Whole Foods
- **Purchase date**: 07/09/22
- **Julie's comments**: Yellowy firm cheese with a blue-ish mottled line in the middle & a maxy tan rind. Tastes like fake butter, but too much, and fake onion slightly. Creamy, fatty taste, also a bit sweet. Tastes processed but doesn't feel processed? I think it's the over the top butter...  **2.15/5**
- **Andrew's comments**: Sue me, I like butter! Tasty, buttery, tangy, with a tiny bit of farmy aftertaste. Interesting texture, semi chewy inside, bit harder rind. Super snackable solo, would also be great grated over pasta.  **4.0/5**

Double Crème Brie (Normandie Brie)

- **Origin**: Canada
- **Milk**: Cow
- **Purchase location**: Weaver Street
- **Purchase date**: 01/31/22
- **Julie's comments**: Mild, soft but not oozy-soft Brie with classic appearance. Creamy but not overwhelmingly so. Rind a bit hard and bitter or dirty-tasting. Overall pretty meh but I don't hate it, which is an improvement for me and Brie I guess.  **2.02/5**
- **Andrew's comments**: Nice classic Brie, a bit creamy, a bit funky, but not too much. Pretty standard for  Brie, but I like Brie. Was better the first couple of days, feels like it lost a bit of flavor.  **3.1/5**

Grand Camembert (Delice de France)

- **Origin**: France
- **Milk**: Cow
- **Purchase location**: Fresh Market
- **Purchase date**: 07/02/22
- **Julie's comments**: Soft off-white cheese with white & tan chalky rind. Brie-like - buttery, rich, creamy interior with mild, salty taste and slight funk that tingles the very back of mouth. Like creamy salted butter that went bad yesterday, but not necessarily in a bad way.  **3.21/5**
- **Andrew's comments**: Extra soft gooey center, pleasingly oily & melts in your mouth. Then outer rind gives just enough texture. Nice creamy brie-like flavor, fairly mild especially upfront. Some salty funk comes in later.  **3.8/5**

Leonara (Mitica)

- **Origin**: Spain
- **Milk**: Goat
- **Purchase location**: Whole Foods
- **Purchase date**: 11/25/21
- **Julie's comments**: Soft white goat's milk cheese, gray rind, looks like brie. Funky & tanky, very creamy, texture almost like cream cheese. At first I didn't like it, but it grew on me. Very rick, but also light/bright.  **4.13/5**
- **Andrew's comments**: Very unusual, creamy & soft like brie but with blue-like funkiness. Great on its own. Would be interesting on a burger.  **4.3/5**

Mild Triple Crème Brie (Wegmans)

- **Origin**: France
- **Milk**: Cow
- **Purchase location**: Wegmans
- **Purchase date**: 12/25/21
- **Julie's comments**: Golly gee so creamy! Buttery with a sour/funky brie taste, salty. Very spreadable - good with flat bread or a stronger cracker flavor. Considering I don't love Brie usually, this is pretty good  **3.49/5**
- **Andrew's comments**: Super creamy and soft, much more than average Brie. Nice chewy rind as contrast. More funky than average brie, subtle Blue notes.  **4.0/5**
- **Thanks to Barb & Rob Necarsulmer for this cheese!**

New Moon (Chapel Hill Creamery)
----------------- 
- **Origin**: North Carolina
- **Milk**: Cow
- **Purchase location**: Weaver Street
- **Purchase date**: 07/10/22
- **Julie's comments**: Soft white cheese - white criss-crossed rind with gooey tan inside, "semi-ripened". Very creamy, semi-salty, funky cheese - like the funk/tang/"electric-ish" flavor that goes to back of throat. A bit too funky for me, but not bad.  **1.97/5**
- **Andrew's comments**: Interesting texture, semi-firm chewy rind with gooey center. Especially cold it has nice mouth feel. Mild up front, salty funky flavor comes in midway through. Interesting unique funk, has grown on me.  **3.5/5**
