- **Julie's comments**: This one has some funk! Salty, umami, with a lot of creamy and a bit of tang. Firm, soft texture (not crumbly) that melts in the mouth. Original taste, different from other pecorinos. Polarizing, I go back and forth.  **2.4/5**
- **Andrew's comments**: A bit funky, nutty, umami. Medium firmness, nice texture with harder rind. I keep going back and forth on this one bite to bite. Addendum: After another couple of days I'm back to liking this less.  **2.2/5**
- **Thanks to Giulia Fragola et al for this cheese!**

- **Julie's comments**: So many Pecorinos! Firm, off-white cheese. Small crumble to it. Very salty tey also creamy, needs balance. Good but not as tasty as Pecorino Toscano. A simpler flavor, seems to have salt crystals in it.  **2.6/5**
- **Andrew's comments**: Very salty & umami, more oily than creamy. Seems like it would be great over pasta, especially pesto. A bit too salty solo.  **2.6/5**
- **Thanks to Tim & Abigail Necarsulmer for this cheese!**

- **Julie's comments**: Oh golly gee this is amazing cheese. Hard, aged cheese with a large crumbly texture. Nutty, rich, creamy and also salty and buttery. Great alone, on a tomato sauce dish tooâ€¦ yummm  **4.79/5**
- **Andrew's comments**: This cheese is so good. Like what Parmesan wants to be after its 10,000 hours. Creamy, salty, nutty, umami. Hard & crumbly but pleasant mouth feel.  **4.8/5**
